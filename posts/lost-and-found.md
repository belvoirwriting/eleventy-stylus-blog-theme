It's October already and where has the time gone? Join us on Tuesday 13 October at 8pm via the magic of Google Meet. The optional theme is 'lost and found' and, as ever, feel free to use this in any way that takes your fancy. Did you once re-find a lost passion for something or someone? Who works in the lost and found office at the train station and what fun do they have with the objects under their care? Where did that cat go and what did they see? Was there ever a corny, comedic double-act called Lost and Found and did they ever get beyond the end of the pier? It's up to you.
